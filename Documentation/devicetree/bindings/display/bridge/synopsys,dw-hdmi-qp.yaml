description: |
  This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare
  HDMI 2.1 Quad-Pixel (QP) TX controller IP core.
  It doesn't constitute a device tree binding specification by itself, but
  is meant to be referenced by platform-specific device tree bindings.

  When referenced from platform device tree bindings, the properties defined
  in this document are defined as follows. The platform device tree bindings
  are responsible for defining whether each property is required or optional.
