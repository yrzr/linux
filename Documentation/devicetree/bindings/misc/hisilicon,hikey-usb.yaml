title: HiKey960/970 onboard USB GPIO Hub

maintainers:

description: |
  Supports the onboard USB GPIO hubs found on HiKey960/970.
  Such hubs require a power supply for the USB I/O. Depending on the
  exact hub model, after USB I/O is powered up, a reset should be needed.

  It also acts as a role-switch intermediary to detect the state of
  the USB-C port, to switch the hub into dual-role USB-C or host mode,
  which enables and powers up the onboard USB-A host ports.

  Schematics about such hubs can be found here:
